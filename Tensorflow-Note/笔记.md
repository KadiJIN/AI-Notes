# Tensorflow
TensorFlow, as the name indicates, is a framework to define and run computations involving tensors. 
## High-level API

### Keras

### Eager Execution

### Importing Data

## Estimators

## Accelerators

## Low-level API

### Tensors

### Variables

### Graphs
A computational graph is a series of TensorFlow operations arranged into a graph. The graph is composed of two types of objects.  
* tf.Operation (or "ops"): The nodes of the graph. Operations describe calculations that consume and produce tensors.
* tf.Tensor: The edges in the graph. These represent the values that will flow through the graph. Most TensorFlow functions return tf.Tensors.

**Important: tf.Tensors do not have values, they are just handles to elements in the computation graph.**
