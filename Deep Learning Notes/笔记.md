# Deep Learning
## Introduction
早期的人工智能解决了人类在智力上难以解决的问题，但这些问题对于计算机来说很简单。真正的难题是解决人们容易执行却很难描述的任务，比如识别文字和图片。
我们人类直观地解决这些任务，非常自然，但对于机器来说不是。本书围绕这一系列的直观问题展开，目的是允许计算机按照概念的层次结构从经验中学习并了解世界。  
To summarize, deep learning, the subject of this book, is an approach to AI.   
Speciﬁcally, it is a type of machine learning, a technique that enables computer systems to improve with experience and data. We contend that machine learning is the only viable approach to building AI systems that can operate in complicated real-world environments. Deep learning is a particular kind of machine learning that achieves great power and ﬂexibility by representing the world as a nested hierarchy of concepts, with each concept deﬁned in relation to simpler concepts, and more abstract representations computed in terms of less abstract ones.  
  
In summary, deep learning is an approach to machine learning that has drawn heavily on our knowledge of the human brain, statistics and applied math as it
developed over the past several decades. In recent years, deep learning has seen tremendous growth in its popularity and usefulness, largely as the result of more powerful computers, larger datasets and techniques to train deeper networks. The years ahead are full of challenges and opportunities to improve deep learning even further and to bring it to new frontiers.
## Applied Math and Machine Learning Basics
### Linear Algebra
线性代数的一些知识  
#### Scalars, Vectors, Matrices and Tensors
Tensors : In some cases we will need an array with more than two axes. In the general case, an array of numbers arranged on a regular grid with a
variable number of axes is known as a tensor. We denote a tensor named “A”with this typeface: A. We identify the element of A at coordinates (i, j, k) by writing A i,j,k.  
One important operation on matrices is the **transpose**. 转置: 把A的横行写为AT的纵列,把A的纵列写为AT的横行
